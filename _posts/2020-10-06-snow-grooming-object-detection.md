title: Object Detection for Autonomous Snow Grooming Applications
---

_This post is a technical overview of my [Metis](https://thisismetis.com){:target="_blank"} capstone project, completed 
over a 3 week span. I developed a proof of concept for autonomous snow grooming vehicles at ski resorts. I accomplished 
this by training a [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497){:target="_blank"} object detection model in 
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to detect/classify obstacles in dash cam footage from vehicles moving through ski 
resort._

The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/stephenjkaplan/snow-grooming-object-detection){:target="_blank"}.
Below is the video presentation I gave as part of my Metis capstone project.
