title: How Did I Get Here (A Casual Cover Letter)
---

How did I get here? In other words, how did I arrive at this moment in time where I am writing my first blog post in a 
personal data science blog? Why am I currently a Data Science student at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/)? 
Reflecting on my "journey" (for lack of a less self-indulgent term) so far has helped me align my next set of career 
goals. 

I'll spare you [my resum√©](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaplanstephen/) in its entirety, but here's a recap for context:

- Graduated from the University of California - Berkeley in 2014 with a B.S. in Mechanical & Nuclear Engineering
- Got a job as a "Mechanical Engineer" (effectively an onboarding engineer) at a small startup in the Bay Area. 
  Transitioned into a mostly [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based Software Engineering role. 
- Short stint at an even smaller incubator stage startup as a Software Engineer.
- 4-years at a large utility-scale solar energy company doing a variety of things including ad-hoc analytics,
  researching and validating physical models for solar power plant performance, to tool development in Python.
- [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) Data Science Bootcamp (current).

Looking at the bulleted list in a vacuum at best implies a vague theme throughout my career (Python...?). However, 
it doesnt tell the full story of how I got to where I am now. I'll pose a few questions and answer them.


#### Why did I study Mechanical & Nuclear Engineering?

I rode my first roller coaster ("Great Bear", pictured below) on a middle school band trip to 
[Hershey Park](https://www.hersheypark.com/) in Pennsylvania. After obsessively surfing the web to learn about every 
roller coaster on Earth, I eventually figured out that you have to study engineering to build roller coasters.

After a few years of subconsciously orienting myself towards an engineering career by centering my focus on 
[STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) classes in middle/high school, 
I happened upon a book that changed my path. The book by Joseph M. Shuster, entitled 
["Beyond Fossil Fools: The Roadmap to Energy Independence by 2040"](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Fossil-Fools-Roadmap-Independence/dp/1592982352), 
discusses the risks of climate change and goes through every viable fossil fuel replacement. The author explains the 
advantages and disadvantages of all possible renewable energy technologies, but his overall thesis is that a mix of 
all carbon-free energy sources is necessary to move away from fossil fuels, including Nuclear Power (which I mention for 
the purpose of foreshadowing.)

This book had a huge impact on me and eventually led me to choose my major at UC Berkeley, Civil & Environmental 
Engineering. I soon realized that I had conflated "Environmental" with "Renewable Energy", and made the first major 
course correction in my career by switching to Mechanical Engineering, which I believed would give me a broad 
understanding of designing things, and maybe put me in a position to work for an electric car company. Soon after, I 
tacked on Nuclear Engineering to my major, keeping the dream alive of maybe landing a job at a firm designing 
next-generation nuclear reactors.

#### What happened at my first job?

As I approached graduation, I was still optimistic about becoming a nuclear engineering professional, but I faced 
two major obstacles:

1. Nuclear Power isn't very popular in the US, and there are a limited set of entry level roles.
2. I wanted to stay in the Bay Area after college, and the handful of nuclear power companies are located elsewhere.

Luckily, I found a role at a startup in Berkeley working on software that improved energy efficiency of commercial 
builds via optimization of HVAC systems. The role I applied for, "Mechanical Engineer", turned out to be more of a 
Sales Engineer/Onboarding Engineer role. Due to the volatile nature of startups, my role was quickly becoming obsolete, 
but I was given the opportunity (which I am eternally thankful for) to learn web development on the job. Within a year 
I was a scrappy, but functional Python/Django/AngularJS developer.


#### Why did I move on and why was that naive?

What followed isn't something I necessarily regret (because I am happy where I ended up)...okay, let's just call it a 
challenging learning experience. I applied to an even smaller startup in the Bay, mostly motivated by a higher salary 
listed on [AngelList](https://angel.co/).

I got the job but was let go within 6 months of working there. In a nutshell, the management style wasn't working for me,
being 1 of 2 engineers wasn't working for me. It was a soul crushing moment so early in my career. Why had I strayed 
so far from my major? Why was I pretending to be a software engineer? 

It's impossible to predict the outcome of every decision in life, but here's my advice to those in the infancy of 
their careers: if you generally are happy with a job, but unhappy with your compensation, it never hurts to just 
*have that conversation* with your manager. Even if your company has a short runway, or whatever the case might be, 
at the very least you'll be able to make an informed decision about your next career move.


#### What was I up to the last 4 years?

The wounds from that job started to turn into scars, and I realized I was in a much better place mentally and 
emotionally, despite a few months of unemployment. A good friend of mine from high school introduced me to the 
Performance & Prediction team at First Solar, and I was soon interviewed and offered a position at their San Francisco 
office.

quick recap of what i did there

got team to take ML course

#### Why did I apply to Metis?

interview at Parsyl plus suggestion
my realization on business trip, mention the perfect timing of Metis start and music


#### What are my goals going forward?
