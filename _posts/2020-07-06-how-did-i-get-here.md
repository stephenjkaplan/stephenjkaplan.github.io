title: How Did I Get Here: A Casual Cover Letter for Self-Reflection
---

How did I get here? In other words, how did I arrive at this moment in time where I am writing my first blog post in a 
personal data science blog? Why am I currently a Data Science student at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/)? 
Reflecting on my "journey" (for lack of a less self-indulgent term) so far has helped me align my next set of career 
goals. 

I'll spare you [my resum√©](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaplanstephen/) in its entirety, but here's a recap for context:

- Graduated from the University of California - Berkeley in 2014 with a B.S. in Mechanical & Nuclear Engineering
- Got a job as a "Mechanical Engineer" (effectively an onboarding engineer) at a small startup in the Bay Area. 
  Transitioned into a mostly [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based Software Engineering role. 
- Short stint at an even smaller incubator stage startup as a Software Engineer.
- 4-years at a large utility-scale solar energy company doing a variety of things including ad-hoc analytics,
  researching and validating physical models for solar power plant performance, to tool development in Python.
- [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) Data Science Bootcamp (current).

Looking at the bulleted list in a vacuum at best implies a vague theme throughout my career (Python...?). However, 
it doesnt tell the full story of how I got to where I am now. I'll pose a few questions and answer them.

#### Why did I study Mechanical & Nuclear Engineering?

I rode my first roller coaster ("Great Bear", pictured below) on a middle school band trip to 
[Hershey Park](https://www.hersheypark.com/) in Pennsylvania. After obsessively surfing the web to learn about every 
roller coaster on Earth, I eventually figured out that you have to study engineering to build roller coasters.

After a few years of subconsciously orienting myself towards an engineering career by centering my focus on 
[STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) classes in middle/high school, 
I happened upon a book that changed my path. The book, entitled 
["Beyond Fossil Fools: The Roadmap to Energy Independence by 2040"](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Fossil-Fools-Roadmap-Independence/dp/1592982352), 
discussed the risks of climate change and...
